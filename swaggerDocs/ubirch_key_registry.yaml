  description:
  
    This is the definition of the ubirch REST API containing the following parts:|
    
    - devices CRUD endpoints

    - key registry endpoints, where public keys of devices and apps can be stored and requested and handshakes between two parties can be performed
    
    - chain service endpoints, to get information about certificates, blockchain entries and bitcoin/etherium anchors to notarize that a message was sent
